# Javascript Web Scraper

This script takes an input from the command line and scraps all of the other links on the webpage.  
It then recursively checks the other links on the same domain to check for links on the other pages.  
The script tracks the count of all of the links that it encounters.

Finally it sends back a nice report of all of the link counts.

### Running the script

To run this program just use from a command line.
```npm run test url```
